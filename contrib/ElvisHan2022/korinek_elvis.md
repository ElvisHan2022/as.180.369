Korinek (2023) argues that generative AI—particularly large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4—has the potential to redefine how economists conduct research by automating repetitive yet cognitively demanding “micro-tasks.” His framework divides these applications into six key domains: ideation and feedback, writing, background research, coding, data analysis, and mathematical derivations. Building on this structure, I plan to integrate several of these tools into my research workflow to enhance both efficiency and depth of analysis.

At the strategic level, LLMs will serve as cognitive collaborators—tools that accelerate idea generation and execution while preserving human oversight in evaluation and interpretation. For ideation and feedback, I will use ChatGPT and Claude to brainstorm research questions, stress-test hypotheses, and surface counterarguments that broaden my analytical scope. For writing, AI will support drafting, editing, and stylistic refinement, transforming bullet points into well-structured academic prose and automating citation formatting. These tools will streamline communication and documentation, allowing me to focus on argumentation and methodological clarity.

For background research, I will rely on AI models to summarize and synthesize literature, identify conceptual links, and clarify technical methods. However, consistent with Korinek’s caution against AI hallucinations, I will verify citations using reliable academic databases such as Google Scholar or Elicit.org. In coding and data analysis, I intend to employ ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis and GitHub Copilot to write and debug code, visualize datasets, and automate data-cleaning processes—particularly useful for handling large hospital-level datasets in my empirical work. Finally, for mathematical modeling, I will use AI to draft and format optimization problems, derive first-order conditions, and provide plain-language explanations of theoretical frameworks, while carefully validating all mathematical steps.

Overall, I view generative AI as a comparative-advantage complement to human research skills: efficient at producing, summarizing, and automating, yet dependent on human expertise for critical evaluation, theoretical reasoning, and contextual interpretation. By incorporating these tools judiciously, I aim to follow Korinek’s vision of human-AI collaboration—one where economists harness automation to deepen insight rather than dilute originality.
