Korinek (2023) highlights how generative AI—especially large language models like GPT-4—can transform economic research by automating “micro-tasks” across six domains: ideation and feedback, writing, background research, coding, data analysis, and mathematical derivations. I plan to incorporate several of these tools into my own workflow. For ideation, I can use ChatGPT or Claude to brainstorm research questions, test hypotheses, and generate counterarguments, while using my own judgment to filter and refine ideas. For writing, AI will help polish drafts, synthesize bullet points into coherent text, and format abstracts, titles, and citations efficiently, freeing time for conceptual work. In background research, LLMs such as Claude can summarize papers or explain complex methods, though I will cross-check citations with databases like Google Scholar or Elicit.org to avoid hallucinated sources. In coding and data analysis, ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis and GitHub Copilot can assist with writing and debugging Python or R scripts, generating visualizations, and reformatting data—particularly useful for handling hospital-level datasets. Finally, for mathematical modeling, I can use AI to express optimization problems in LaTeX or explain derivation steps, while verifying the algebra manually. Overall, I intend to use generative AI as a “junior research assistant”: fast and versatile for automating small, cognitive tasks, but guided by human oversight and critical judgment, in line with Korinek’s vision of productive human-AI collaboration in economic research.
