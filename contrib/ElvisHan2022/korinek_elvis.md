Korinek (2011), “The New Economics of Inequality and Redistribution,” presents a framework for understanding how rising income inequality interacts with macroeconomic outcomes and policy responses. Korinek argues that traditional welfare analyses often understate the efficiency costs of inequality because they ignore externalities—such as underinvestment in human capital, distorted aggregate demand, and political capture by the wealthy. The paper integrates micro- and macro-level perspectives, showing how inequality can create feedback loops that reduce overall welfare and alter the optimal design of redistribution. In doing so, it bridges public economics, macroeconomics, and political economy, emphasizing that redistribution is not merely a moral or social question but a structural determinant of economic efficiency and stability.
