## Abstract

This study investigates whether hospital readmission penalties under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) reflect genuine quality differences or structural inequities in patient populations. Using Medicare hospital-level data from CMS (FY2016–2019), the analysis links excess readmission ratios (ERRs), discharge DRG weights, and dual-eligibility proportions to evaluate how financial penalties interact with hospital case mix and socioeconomic status. The project develops an “Observation Substitution Index” (OSI) to measure potential substitution of readmissions with observation stays, a behavior hypothesized to mitigate penalties without improving outcomes.

Preliminary results suggest systematic variation in ERRs and DRG weights across peer groups, implying that hospitals serving higher proportions of dual-eligible patients may face disproportionate penalties. By combining cross-sectional regressions with a proposed difference-in-differences framework, this project seeks to distinguish quality-driven performance from social and structural confounding. Findings will inform whether HRRP’s financial incentives align with equitable, outcome-based policy goals or inadvertently reinforce disparities in safety-net institutions.
