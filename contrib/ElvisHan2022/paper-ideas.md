# Project Pitches for Final Paper

## 1. Opioid Prescribing Caps and Substitution Decisions

**Topic & Hypothesis.**  
I will examine how state-level opioid prescribing caps influence physician decision-making, specifically whether these caps reduce opioid prescriptions or instead lead to substitution toward alternative pain management drugs. My hypothesis is that prescribing limits decrease the overall supply of opioids but generate a compensatory rise in prescriptions of non-opioid pain medications, such as gabapentin or NSAIDs. This substitution effect reflects the incentives and uncertainty that providers face: they must manage patient pain while avoiding regulatory penalties, leading to altered prescribing decisions under new policy constraints.  

**Design & Data.**  
Using 2010–2022 state-level panel data from the CDC Opioid Prescribing Dataset and the DEA’s ARCOS system, I will implement a difference-in-differences design that compares states adopting opioid prescribing caps against those without such policies, before and after implementation. The outcomes of interest will include per-capita opioid prescribing rates, prescriptions of substitute pain medications, and opioid-related hospitalization rates as a secondary outcome. Controls will include demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare access variables from Census and CMS data. I will also estimate event-study models to capture dynamic policy effects and run placebo tests on unrelated drug classes to strengthen causal inference. This setup directly operationalizes the theme of **incentives, uncertainty, and decisions** in healthcare policy, while producing technically rigorous and policy-relevant results.

## 2. Telehealth Reimbursement Expansion and Care Utilization

**Topic & Hypothesis.**  
I will study how state-level telehealth reimbursement expansions, accelerated during and after COVID-19, affect healthcare utilization patterns. My hypothesis is that expanding reimbursement for telehealth reduces uncertainty about access and out-of-pocket cost, incentivizing patients to substitute some in-person visits with virtual care. I also expect heterogeneous effects: larger substitution in primary care and behavioral health, and less in specialties requiring procedures or imaging.  

**Design & Data.**  
I will build a panel dataset of state telehealth reimbursement laws (sourced from the Center for Connected Health Policy) linked with utilization data from the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and, where available, CMS Medicare claims. The difference-in-differences design will exploit variation in the timing of state adoption of telehealth reimbursement parity laws. Outcomes will include frequency of primary-care visits, behavioral health visits, and ED visits. Controls will cover demographics, broadband penetration, and provider supply. I will estimate two-way fixed effects models, supplemented with event studies to examine pre-trends and dynamics. This project applies a novel DiD framework to a rapidly evolving area, illuminating how **incentives, uncertainty, and decisions** shape the uptake of telehealth in U.S. healthcare systems.

## 3. Value-Based Care and Hospital Performance

**Topic & Hypothesis.**  
I will analyze the effect of the federal Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) — a major value-based care initiative — on hospital readmission rates and care delivery decisions. My hypothesis is that HRRP penalties incentivized hospitals to reduce readmissions for targeted conditions (heart failure, pneumonia, AMI) but may have introduced uncertainty in care quality tradeoffs, such as increased observation stays or delayed discharges.  

**Design & Data.**  
Using 2008–2020 hospital-level panel data from CMS Hospital Compare and Medicare claims, I will employ a difference-in-differences design comparing targeted conditions (subject to HRRP penalties) to non-targeted conditions before and after HRRP implementation. Outcomes include 30-day readmission rates, length of stay, observation-stay use, and mortality. Controls will cover hospital size, teaching status, payer mix, and regional demographics. I will also estimate event-study models to capture dynamic responses over time. This project highlights how **incentives in value-based care** reshape provider decisions under policy-driven uncertainty, yielding insights on both intended and unintended consequences of performance-based payment.
