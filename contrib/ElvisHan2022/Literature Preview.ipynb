    "### Albritton et al. 2018 — *Health Affairs*\n",
    "- **Question:** Did HRRP reduce 30-day HF readmissions and were reductions offset by observation stays?\n",
    "- **Data & Filters:** Medicare FFS 2006–2014 (HF vs non-targets). Excluded small-volume hospitals and those with **<5 observation stays** to stabilize estimates.\n",
    "- **Method:** DiD for readmit vs observation trends.\n",
    "- **Findings:** Readmissions fell, observation rose nearly 1-for-1 → total acute use ≈ unchanged.\n",
    "- **Implication:** HRRP improved metrics more than utilization; outcomes (mortality/OOP) not tied to substitution.\n",

    "## Research Question\n",
    "**To what extent did hospitals’ substitution of inpatient readmissions into observation stays under HRRP increase Medicare beneficiaries’ financial and welfare burdens—measured by out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, skilled nursing facility (SNF) access, and mortality—and how do these effects differ for penalized vs. unpenalized hospitals?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "HRRP modestly reduced readmissions but spurred substitution into **observation stays** (e.g., Wright 2023: +0.02 pp/month; Albritton 2018: +5.4% pre/post-30-day cliff among non-penalized hospitals). Observation is billed under Part B, exposing beneficiaries to higher OOP costs and **SNF ineligibility** (three-day inpatient rule). Penalties fall more heavily on safety-net hospitals, and several studies suggest mortality may worsen for certain conditions.  \n",
    "This study centers observation in HRRP evaluation via a hospital-level **Observation Substitution Index (OSI)**, then quantifies how **penalized vs. unpenalized** status moderates the relationship between substitution and patient harm (OOP, SNF access, mortality). Using Medicare claims (2008–2020), I deploy event studies and difference-in-differences with hospital and time FE, plus robustness with RD around day-30 and IV using **expected penalty pressure**. Findings will inform whether CMS should include observation in quality metrics and revise SNF eligibility rules.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction (condensed)\n",
    "- HRRP (FY2013) penalizes excess 30-day readmissions (initially HF, AMI, pneumonia; later COPD, joint replacement).\n",
    "- Evidence indicates substitution **from readmits → observation** without reducing total acute revisits; mortality and equity concerns persist.\n",
    "- **Gap:** Patient-level **financial and access harms** from substitution remain under-measured; penalty context (penalized vs unpenalized) may shape strategies and impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Flow\n",
    "HRRP penalties  \n",
    "→ Hospitals reduce measured readmits  \n",
    "→ **Substitute** to observation (and sometimes ED)  \n",
    "→ Patients face **higher OOP**, **lost SNF coverage**, potential **outcome harms**  \n",
    "→ Effects may differ by **penalty status** (penalized vs unpenalized) and **safety-net** status.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "1. **Substitution & Costs:** Higher-OSI hospitals exhibit larger **post-HRRP increases in OOP** per patient.  \n",
    "2. **SNF Access:** Higher OSI is associated with **lower probability of covered SNF** use within 30 days.  \n",
    "3. **Mortality:** Higher OSI is associated with **higher 30-/90-day mortality**.  \n",
    "4. **Penalty Heterogeneity:** Relationships in H1–H3 are **stronger among penalized hospitals** and/or hospitals with higher **penalty intensity**.\n",

    "- **Penalty heterogeneity:** Shows penalized hospitals substitute more, harming patients more.  \n",
    "- **Policy relevance:** Evidence for counting obs in HRRP metrics, revising SNF rule, and adjusting for social risk.  \n",
