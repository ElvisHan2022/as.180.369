    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — HRRP Observation Substitution Study\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)**, launched by CMS in 2013, penalizes hospitals with excess 30-day readmissions for specific conditions.  \n",
    "While intended to improve quality, research suggests hospitals may have **reclassified patients into “observation stays”** to avoid penalties.  \n",
    "This project explores whether such behavior represents **true efficiency gains or strategic substitution**, and whether it affected **patient welfare** through higher out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and reduced post-acute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 2. Data Overview\n",

    "| Dataset | Description | Main Variables | Role in Analysis |\n",
    "|----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **CPS Medicare Summary (A/B)** | National spending and utilization by Medicare Part A (inpatient) and Part B (outpatient) from 2008–2021. | `Year`, `Part A Payments`, `Part B Payments` | Context: system-wide shift from inpatient to outpatient after HRRP. |\n",
    "| **HRRP Supplemental File** | Hospital-condition-level penalties and readmission metrics. | `Provider ID`, `Condition`, `ERR`, `Payment Adjustment Factor` | Incentive variation — quantifies penalty exposure. |\n",
    "| **Inpatient Provider Utilization** | Volume of inpatient discharges by DRG per hospital. | `DRG Definition`, `Discharges` | Measures readmissions (Part A). |\n",
    "| **Outpatient Provider Utilization** | Outpatient service counts, including observation codes. | `HCPCS`, `Services` (`G0378`, `G0379`) | Measures observation stays (Part B). |\n",
    "| **Nursing Home Claims-Based Quality Measures** | SNF-level quality outcomes from Medicare claims. | `qm_label`, `qm_value`, `provider_number` | Welfare outcomes: rehospitalization, community discharge, MSPB. |\n",
    "| **Hospital Info / AHA Survey** | Hospital characteristics. | `Ownership`, `Bed Size`, `Teaching Status`, `Region` | Structural controls for heterogeneity. |\n",

    "## 3. Visualization Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The EDA explores each link in the causal chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy → Incentive → Behavior → Welfare**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stage | Purpose | Expected Trend |\n",
    "|--------|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **System Context** | Show macro shift from inpatient to outpatient spending. | Part A ↓, Part B ↑ after 2013. |\n",
    "| **Incentive Exposure** | Quantify penalty heterogeneity across hospitals and conditions. | ERR variation around 1.0, negative ERR–penalty slope. |\n",
    "| **Behavioral Response** | Detect substitution between readmissions and observation stays. | Readmissions ↓, Observations ↑. |\n",
    "| **Welfare Impact** | Link substitution to patient outcomes. | High OSI → worse SNF rehosp, lower community discharge. |\n",

    "## 4. Visualizations Conducted\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 System-Level Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Examine whether HRRP coincided with a macro shift from inpatient (Part A) to outpatient (Part B) utilization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** CPS Medicare Summary A/B (2008–2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visuals:**\n",
    "1. **Line chart** — Part A vs. Part B total payments over time.\n",
    "2. **Stacked area chart** — Share of total Medicare spending by Part.\n",
    "3. **Annotated line** — HRRP launch (2013) marked with vertical dashed line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Insight:**  \n",
    "A plateau or decline in Part A and rise in Part B around 2013 indicates reclassification trends consistent with HRRP incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Incentive Exposure**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Visualize variation in penalty exposure among hospitals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** HRRP Supplemental File  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Visuals:**\n",
    "1. **Histogram of ERR values** — to show how many hospitals exceed the penalty threshold (ERR = 1.0).  \n",
    "2. **Scatterplot of ERR vs Payment Adjustment Factor** — verifies penalties increase as ERR rises.  \n",
    "3. **Line plot of % penalized hospitals by year** — tracks HRRP intensity over time.  \n",
    "4. **Heatmap of ERR by condition × year** — identifies conditions driving penalties (HF, COPD).  \n",
    "5. **Boxplot of penalties by ownership/teaching status** — explores heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Insight:**  \n",
    "Penalties vary widely, creating differential incentive pressure across hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Behavioral Response (Substitution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Test whether hospitals substituted readmissions with observation stays.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets:** Medicare Inpatient + Outpatient Provider Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Variable:**\n",
    "- **Observation Substitution Index (OSI)** = ΔObservation / |ΔReadmission|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visuals:**\n",
    "1. **Dual line plot** — average readmission vs. observation rates (2008–2020).  \n",
    "2. **Scatterplot:** ERR vs. OSI — do lower-penalty hospitals substitute more?  \n",
    "3. **Boxplot:** OSI by penalty quartile — distribution of substitution intensity.  \n",
    "4. **Event-study plot:** Observation rates before vs. after first penalty year.  \n",
    "5. **Choropleth map:** Average OSI by state or CBSA — regional substitution patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Insight:**  \n",
    "A strong negative correlation between readmission and observation rates post-2013 suggests strategic substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.4 Welfare Outcomes (Post-Acute Effects)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Determine whether substitution affected patient-level welfare (SNF quality and continuity of care).  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Visuals:**\n",

    "2. **Scatterplot:** Regional OSI vs. SNF rehospitalization rates.  \n",
    "3. **Boxplot:** Community discharge rates by OSI quartile.  \n",
    "4. **Map:** SNF quality index vs. OSI (spatial relationship).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Insight:**  \n",
    "Regions with higher substitution intensity show worse post-acute outcomes, implying welfare loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.5 Robustness & Pre-Trends**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Validate assumptions for Difference-in-Differences (DiD) identification.  \n",

    "2. **Transition matrix:** Probability of remaining penalized year-to-year.  \n",
    "3. **Boxplot:** OSI by structural characteristics (ownership, teaching status, urbanicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Insight:**  \n",
    "Parallel pre-trends before HRRP and stable penalty groups confirm quasi-experimental validity.\n",

    "## 5. Key Exploratory Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "| Question | Evidence from Visuals |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| **Did HRRP coincide with inpatient → outpatient shift?** | Yes — post-2013 inflection in Part A vs. B spending. |\n",
    "| **Was penalty pressure heterogeneous?** | Yes — ERR and penalties vary by hospital and condition. |\n",
    "| **Did hospitals substitute readmissions with observation stays?** | Visuals show clear negative correlation; substitution concentrated in penalized hospitals. |\n",
    "| **Did substitution affect welfare?** | Preliminary evidence: higher OSI regions show higher SNF rehospitalization rates and lower community discharge. |\n",
    "| **Are trends robust pre-HRRP?** | Pre-2013 trends parallel; changes appear policy-driven. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Next Analytical Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantify substitution** more precisely by computing OSI per hospital-year.  \n",
    "2. **Merge datasets** by hospital or region to test causal pathways:\n",
    "   - HRRP Penalty → OSI → SNF Quality  \n",
    "3. **Estimate DiD / DDD models** using 2013 as policy onset:\n",
    "   - Outcome = β(Post × Penalized) + μ_h + λ_t + ε  \n",
    "4. **Assess welfare impact** via changes in OOP spending, SNF access, and rehospitalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These EDA visuals establish a strong conceptual and empirical foundation for causal analysis of HRRP’s behavioral and welfare effects.\n",
