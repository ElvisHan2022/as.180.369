    "# Hospitals’ Behavioral Adaptation under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)\n",

    "## 1. Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)**, implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2013, penalizes hospitals with excess 30-day readmissions for selected conditions.  \n",
    "While the policy aimed to improve care coordination and reduce preventable rehospitalizations, emerging research suggests that hospitals may have **optimized behaviorally rather than clinically** — through administrative adjustments such as observation substitution, upcoding, and timing manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal outlines a data-driven exploratory and causal analysis plan that investigates whether HRRP produced genuine efficiency gains or merely reshaped reporting and classification behavior. It links **incentive exposure** (penalties) to **behavioral adaptation** (hospital responses) and finally to **welfare outcomes** (patient costs, post-acute access, and quality).\n",

    "## 2. Literature Insight: Gupta & Fonarow (2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Gupta & Fonarow (2018), *The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program — Learning from Failure of a Healthcare Policy*, highlighted several critical points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited success:** HRRP reduced readmissions modestly (≈9%), far less than the expected 25%.  \n",
    "- **Gaming behaviors:** Hospitals adapted by:  \n",
    "  1. **Upcoding:** Raising recorded severity to inflate expected readmissions.  \n",
    "  2. **Observation substitution:** Reclassifying readmissions as outpatient “observation stays.”  \n",
    "  3. **Timing manipulation:** Delaying rehospitalizations beyond 30 days.  \n",
    "- **Equity problem:** Safety-net hospitals faced disproportionate penalties due to lack of socioeconomic risk adjustment.  \n",
    "- **Mortality effects:** Rising heart-failure mortality post-HRRP suggested unintended harm.  \n",
    "- **Policy lesson:** Financial incentives can misfire when performance metrics are narrow or misaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Impact on Research Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, this project aimed to test Gupta’s **observation substitution** hypothesis using outpatient data. However, preliminary exploratory analysis revealed that observation stays **did not rise** post-2013 — contradicting expectations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This “null result” reshaped the approach into a broader behavioral framework examining three potential mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mechanism | Behavioral Channel | New Data/Index Introduced |\n",
    "|------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| **Observation substitution** | Reclassifying inpatient returns as outpatient observation | **Observation Substitution Index (OSI)** |\n",
    "| **Upcoding** | Inflating coded severity or expected readmissions | **Coding Intensity Index** |\n",
    "| **Timing manipulation** | Delaying readmissions beyond 30 days | **Timing Manipulation Index (Bunching)** |\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight also motivated exploration of **equity heterogeneity** — testing whether resource-rich hospitals (teaching, urban, for-profit) had greater capacity to adapt strategically than safety-net or rural hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Tension Between Administrative Aggregates and Service-Level Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Conceptual Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In evaluating HRRP, one of the most significant practical challenges lies in reconciling **aggregate administrative data** (system-level trends) with **micro-level provider data** (hospital behavior).  \n",
    "The two data types represent fundamentally different lenses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medicare Summary (CPS A/B):** National spending and utilization aggregates under Part A (inpatient) and Part B (outpatient). It reflects **system-wide shifts** but masks local variation.  \n",
    "- **Provider and Service-Level Data:** Detailed hospital-level discharge, charge, and DRG records capturing **behavioral responses** at the point of care.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets reveal different truths:  \n",
    "- The **CPS summary** tells *what happened overall* — a shift from inpatient to outpatient spending.  \n",
    "- The **provider-level data** tell *how hospitals individually behaved* — who coded differently, delayed readmissions, or faced penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Comparison and Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Medicare Summary (CPS A/B) | Provider-Level (Inpatient/Outpatient) |\n",
    "|------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Unit of Observation** | Year / National | Provider × DRG × Year |\n",
    "| **Analytical Level** | Population / Aggregate | Micro / Behavioral |\n",
    "| **Strength** | Captures macro inflection after HRRP | Reveals heterogeneity and incentive sensitivity |\n",
    "| **Limitation** | Masks variation by hospital type | Lacks full spending and policy context |\n",
    "| **Best Use** | Contextual validation of HRRP impact | Causal analysis of behavioral adaptation |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Empirical Tension Observed\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data explored so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPS Medicare Summary (A/B)** shows a sharp **pivot after 2013**, with Part A spending flattening and Part B spending rising — consistent with national-level substitution from inpatient to outpatient care.  \n",
    "- **Provider-Level Data**, however, reveal **no corresponding drop** in discharges or case counts. Instead, hospitals report **rising per-case charges and increasing severity mix**, hinting at *administrative adaptation rather than clinical substitution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contradiction raises key interpretive questions:  \n",
    "- Did hospitals *actually shift* utilization patterns (true substitution)?  \n",
    "- Or did they *relabel* and *recode* activity (strategic reporting)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this mismatch is central to distinguishing **real efficiency gains** from **metric optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Integrative Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than choosing between datasets, the project integrates both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Macro Validation (CPS A/B):** Identify system-wide inflection points and policy timing effects.  \n",
    "   - *Visualization:* Line chart of Part A vs. Part B payments (2008–2021).  \n",
    "   - *Interpretation:* Confirms whether HRRP coincided with structural change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Micro Causal Analysis (Provider-Level):**  \n",
    "   Quantify whether hospital penalties correspond with shifts in readmissions, observation stays, or coding intensity.  \n",
    "   - *Visualization:* Scatterplots of ERR vs. Δcharges or OSI; event-study trends around 2013.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Crosswalk / Synthesis:**  \n",
    "   Compare whether the magnitude of hospital-level substitution can account for national trends.  \n",
    "   - If not, remaining variation may stem from upcoding or reporting shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-level approach transforms the tension between datasets into a **triangulation strategy** — using each to validate or challenge the other.\n",
    "\n",

    "> **Research Question:**  \n",
