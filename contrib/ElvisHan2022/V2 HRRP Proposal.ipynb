    "# Hospitals’ Substitution under HRRP: Patient Financial Burden, Access, and Quality Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Value-based payment reforms aim to realign provider incentives away from volume and toward value. The **Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)** penalizes hospitals with excess 30-day readmissions for targeted conditions, intending to improve care coordination and reduce preventable rehospitalizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when penalties apply only to inpatient readmissions, hospitals can **reclassify returning patients as observation stays** billed under Medicare Part B. This behavior lowers measured readmissions but can **shift costs to patients**, **reduce access to post-acute care**, and **fragment care continuity**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study evaluates the **costs and benefits** of HRRP by quantifying the extent of **observation substitution** and assessing its downstream effects on patient welfare, quality, and financial burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature on HRRP examines how financial incentives affect hospital behavior, quality, and efficiency. It focuses on four questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did HRRP change **readmissions**, **observation stays**, and **ED visits**?  \n",
    "2. Did these changes affect **mortality**, **continuity**, and **patient outcomes**?  \n",
    "3. How did effects differ by **hospital type** and **social risk**?  \n",
    "4. Did HRRP generate **net value** when accounting for patient costs?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Readmissions, Observation, and ED Utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical studies show that HRRP **reduced inpatient readmissions** but caused **increases in observation stays and ED visits**, reflecting hospitals’ strategic response to avoid penalties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sheehy (2021)*, *Wright (2023)*, and *Albritton (2017, 2018)* document large shifts toward observation care.  \n",
    "- *Gupta (2018, 2021)* and *Catalyst (2018)* confirm system-wide substitution patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** HRRP achieved its numerical goal but induced **reclassification behavior**, which may not reflect true quality improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Mortality and Clinical Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidence on mortality is **mixed**.  \n",
    "- *Gupta (2017)*, *Fonarow (2017)*, and *Qiu (2018)* report higher mortality for heart failure post-HRRP.  \n",
    "- *Murray (2021)* and *Samarghandi (2019)* attribute these findings to confounding by patient demographics and risk selection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond mortality, studies note higher **ED revisits**, **longer observation durations**, and **shorter inpatient stays**, suggesting reduced continuity of care.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** Mortality alone underestimates HRRP’s impact; **continuity metrics** like ED revisits and follow-up rates better capture post-policy quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Financial Burden and Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation billing under **Part B** increases **out-of-pocket (OOP)** liabilities and prevents Medicare coverage for **Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)** stays under the “three-day rule.”  \n",
    "While *Gupta (2018; 2021)* and *Catalyst (2018)* discuss these mechanisms, few quantify them, leaving the **patient welfare impact** largely unmeasured.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Heterogeneity and Equity\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Rogstad (2022)* and *Evans (2021)* highlight that social determinants and socioeconomic risk factors drive readmission rates.  \n",
    "- *Kirsch (2024)* finds HRRP penalties fall disproportionately on **safety-net hospitals** and clinicians, potentially widening equity gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Economic Value and Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The program’s efficiency is debated:  \n",
    "- *Yakusheva (2020)* and *Nuckols (2017)* find limited net savings after considering offsetting costs.  \n",
    "- *Sheehy (2023)* critiques HRRP’s **measurement design**, arguing that it rewards coding behavior more than genuine value creation.  \n",
    "- *Rothstein (2009)* similarly shows that incentive programs can shift costs without improving welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** Evaluating HRRP requires a **cost–benefit framework** balancing system savings against patient burdens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.7 Synthesis and Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Consensus | Remaining Gap |\n",
    "|------------|------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Readmissions ↓, Observation ↑ | Strong | No index quantifying substitution intensity |\n",
    "| Mortality & Quality | Mixed | Need multidimensional metrics |\n",
    "| Patient Burden | Recognized | Sparse quantitative evidence |\n",
    "| Equity | Important | Limited causal identification |\n",
    "| Economic Value | Unclear | No welfare accounting model |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "Existing studies confirm that hospitals substituted observation for readmissions but rarely quantify **patient-level financial and access harms**. This project fills that gap using a hospital-level **Observation Substitution Index (OSI)** linked to outcomes such as OOP, SNF coverage, and ED churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Under HRRP (implemented FY2013), hospitals faced direct penalties for readmissions but none for observation care. This asymmetric incentive led to **strategic substitution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{HRRP Penalties} \\Rightarrow \\text{↓ Readmissions, ↑ Observation Stays}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift has several potential **downstream effects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher **OOP spending** (Part B billing)  \n",
    "- Reduced **SNF eligibility** (three-day rule)  \n",
    "- Increased **ED/OBS churn** and delayed follow-up  \n",
    "- Possible increases in **mortality** or missed admissions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observation Substitution:**  \n",
    "   Hospitals with higher OSI values experience greater post-HRRP increases in patient OOP spending.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access:**  \n",
    "   High-OSI hospitals show larger declines in covered SNF admissions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality:**  \n",
    "   High-OSI hospitals exhibit higher ED revisits and longer observation durations, reflecting degraded continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Research Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Observation Substitution Index (OSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Define OSI as the ratio of a hospital’s change in observation rate to its reduction in readmission rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "OSI_h = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Observation Rate}_h}{|\\Delta \\text{Readmission Rate}_h|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta$ represents the change between pre- (2008–2012) and post-HRRP (2013–2019) periods.\n",

    "#### Triple Difference (DDD)\n",
