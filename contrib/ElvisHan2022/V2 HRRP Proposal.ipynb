    "# Behavioral Adaptation under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP): Substitution, Upcoding, and Timing Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), introduced under the Affordable Care Act in 2013, penalizes hospitals with excess 30-day readmissions for select conditions to promote value-based care. Early studies posited that hospitals **“gamed” the system** by shifting returning patients from inpatient readmissions (penalized) to outpatient **observation stays** (unpenalized). However, recent analyses—including my own examination of Medicare Part A and B data—show that **observation stays actually decreased** in the aggregate post-HRRP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This finding raises a central question: *If hospitals were not substituting into observation stays, how did they adapt to HRRP incentives?*  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project re-examines HRRP’s behavioral effects by comparing three potential mechanisms of hospital response:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Substitution** — reclassification of readmissions into observation stays.  \n",
    "2. **Upcoding** — inflating case-mix severity (higher DRG weights) to reduce apparent readmission risk.  \n",
    "3. **Timing Shifts** — delaying readmissions beyond 30 days or increasing early post-discharge mortality to avoid penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using linked **MedPAR**, **Outpatient**, and **MBSF** data (2008–2020) with hospital-level penalty exposure, I will quantify how each mechanism evolved and whether these adaptations differed across **safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By disentangling behavioral channels, this study provides a more accurate understanding of how hospitals internalize incentive-based regulation—clarifying whether HRRP improved efficiency or merely altered reporting behavior.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Policy Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) ties Medicare reimbursement to hospitals’ 30-day readmission performance for specific conditions such as heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia. Hospitals exceeding national averages face up to a 3% reduction in total Medicare payments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This design created strong incentives to reduce measured readmissions—but **only within the 30-day inpatient window**, leaving open alternative ways to avoid penalties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevailing literature argues that hospitals responded by increasing **observation stays**—short outpatient admissions not counted as readmissions (Gupta 2018; Sheehy 2021).  \n",
    "Yet, new descriptive analysis using Medicare Part A and B data from 2008–2020 reveals that **observation utilization actually fell** over time, contradicting prior claims.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This empirical puzzle suggests that hospitals may have adapted through other, less visible channels such as **coding adjustments, discharge timing manipulation, or triage changes**, rather than simple substitution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This study investigates the full set of behavioral margins available to hospitals under HRRP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Did hospitals **substitute** readmissions with observation stays, or did overall post-discharge encounters decline?  \n",
    "2. Did hospitals **upcode** DRG severity to appear compliant while offsetting penalties?  \n",
    "3. Did hospitals **shift timing**, delaying readmissions or increasing early mortality?  \n",
    "4. How did these responses vary between **safety-net** and **non-safety-net** hospitals?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitals maximize net revenue under HRRP subject to constraints on quality and resource availability. When penalized, they may respond by:\n",
    "- **Reclassification** (substitution);\n",
    "- **Coding adjustment** (administrative inflation);\n",
    "- **Temporal shifting** (postponing readmissions beyond penalty window).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each channel represents an attempt to reduce measured readmissions without necessarily improving patient outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Literature Review (Condensed)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Substitution:** Early HRRP studies (Zuckerman 2016; Gupta 2018) found increased observation stays, though later evidence (Yakusheva 2020; Wright 2023) shows these effects are smaller and inconsistent.  \n",
    "- **Upcoding:** Ibrahim et al. (2018) estimate that up to two-thirds of reported readmission reductions may reflect administrative risk inflation rather than genuine improvement.  \n",
    "- **Timing:** Gupta and Fonarow (2018) document declines in 30-day readmissions but stable 90-day readmissions and rising mortality—consistent with delayed readmission or premature discharge.  \n",
    "- **Equity:** Joynt (2013) and Rogstad (2022) find that HRRP disproportionately penalized safety-net hospitals serving lower-income populations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds on these strands by analyzing all three behavioral mechanisms within one unified framework and linking them directly to hospital penalty exposure.\n",

    "## 7. Policy Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broaden measurement:** Incorporate observation stays and post-30-day events into readmission metrics.  \n",
    "- **Strengthen monitoring:** Track DRG-weight inflation to detect administrative gaming.  \n",
    "- **Protect equity:** Adjust HRRP penalties for social risk and hospital resource constraints.  \n",
